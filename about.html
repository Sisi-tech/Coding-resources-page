                "I'm someone who is dedicated to personal growth and constantly strives to become a better individual. 
                My journey led me to discover a profound passion for coding, 
                which I embarked on in August of last year. 
                I commit my time to learning after work hours and during weekends, 
                actively participating in viral tech meetings and local in-person meetups. 
                Through this process, I've had the privilege to connect with a diverse group of individuals, 
                each with their unique backgrounds and stories.
                <br>
                Listening to their experiences has been a continuous source of inspiration for me. 
                This journey has not only been about acquiring technical skills but has also enriched my life by exposing me to different perspectives. 
                I'm excited about the idea of compiling the valuable resources I've gathered and received from these friends. Together, 
                we're building a supportive and dynamic community of learners."
